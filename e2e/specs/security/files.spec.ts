 * A stored file URL is data somebody typed at some point.
 *
 * Every file a workshop uploads is kept as a URL on a record, and that URL is
 * later turned into a path on disk and read, copied or unlinked. The audit
 * found it joined onto the upload folder with no containment check, so a
 * record carrying `../../.env` read the server's own files into a PDF. Three
 * layers stand in the way now: the file routes refuse a path with a dot pair,
 * the actions refuse to store a URL that is not one of this workshop's own
 * uploads, and the path resolver refuses to leave the folder for whatever is
 * stored already.
 *
 * And an SVG is a document with scripts in it: uploaded as a logo it ran for
 * every visitor on the app's origin. Uploads are decoded and re-encoded now,
 * and a stored SVG is offered as a download inside a sandbox.
